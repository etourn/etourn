# Hey there 👋

I'm ET, a junior studying Computer Science and Economics at Grinnell College.  

I’m interested in combining Computer Science and Economics to solve real-world challenges by exploring UI design, mobile development, and practical AI applications through hands-on software projects.

I have experience programming in Python, Java, C#, and C, with coursework and skills in UI/UX, mobile development, software engineering, artificial intelligence, operating systems, and econometrics.

I’ve worked as a Student Researcher on Complex Networks and a Web Design Intern.
